A specialized database designed for Reverse ETL scenarios, optimized for serving data warehouse data to online systems with low latency.

## Overview

rETL DB is a high-performance database system built in C that specializes in:

1. **Bulk data operations** - Optimized for full table or partition replacements rather than row-level mutations
2. **Fast point lookups** - Sub-millisecond response times for key-based queries
3. **Efficient analytical queries** - Fast aggregations and grouping operations

Unlike traditional databases, rETL DB is specifically designed for reverse ETL workflows where data is periodically synchronized from a data warehouse to serve online systems efficiently.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Early Development** - This project is in the initial development phase (Phase 1: Core Engine and Storage).

## Features (Planned)

- Columnar storage format for efficient analytical queries
- Row-based indexes for fast point lookups
- Immutable data files with LSM-tree approach
- Partition-based storage for efficient bulk replacements
- Memory-mapped files for high-performance access
- Simple SQL interface for queries
- Optimized for read-heavy workloads
- C library with bindings for popular languages

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (version 3.15+)
- LZ4 and Snappy compression libraries
