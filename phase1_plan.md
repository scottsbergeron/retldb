## Technical Details

### Storage Format Specification

The on-disk format will consist of the following components:

1. **File Header**
   - Magic number: "RETLDB"
   - Version information
   - Schema reference
   - Creation timestamp
   - Checksum

2. **Column Chunks**
   - Column metadata (type, encoding, compression)
   - Statistics (min, max, null count)
   - Offset to data
   - Compressed data block

3. **Footer**
   - Column chunk offsets
   - Row count
   - File-level statistics
   - Checksum

### Memory Management

Memory will be managed using a hybrid approach:

1. **Memory-Mapped Files**
   - Used for metadata and indexes
   - Configurable mapping size
   - Protection against mapping too much data

2. **Buffer Pool**
   - Used for data files that are too large to map
   - LRU eviction policy
   - Configurable buffer size
   - Pre-fetching capabilities

### Data Types

The initial implementation will support the following data types:

1. **Primitive Types**
   - Integer (8, 16, 32, 64-bit)

   - Boolean
   - String (UTF-8)
   - Binary
   - Timestamp

2. **Complex Types** (basic support)
   - Array
   - Map
   - Struct

### Partition Strategy

Partitioning will support:

1. **Partition Keys**
   - Single or multiple columns
   - Range-based partitioning
   - Hash-based partitioning
   - List-based partitioning

2. **Partition Operations**
   - Creation
   - Splitting

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| On-disk format design flaws | High | Medium | Thorough review, prototyping, flexibility for future changes |
| Memory management issues | High | Medium | Extensive testing, memory profiling, clear ownership rules |
| Performance below targets | Medium | Medium | Early benchmarking, performance-focused code reviews |
| Cross-platform compatibility issues | Medium | Low | Abstraction layers, platform-specific testing |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Strict adherence to Phase 1 requirements, regular progress reviews |

## Next Steps After Phase 1

Upon successful completion of Phase 1, the project will move to Phase 2, focusing on:

1. Implementing indexing structures
2. Creating the basic query execution engine
3. Supporting simple point queries

The foundation built in Phase 1 will be critical for the success of these next steps, particularly the storage engine and metadata management components.
