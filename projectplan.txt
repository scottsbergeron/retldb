# rETL DB Project Plan

## Project Overview

rETL DB is a specialized database designed for Reverse ETL scenarios. It serves as a low-latency data store that receives copies of source-of-truth data from data warehouses to serve online systems efficiently. The database is optimized for:

1. Bulk data operations (full table or partition replacements/additions) rather than row-level mutations
2. Fast row-level lookups (SELECT WHERE id = X)
3. Efficient analytical queries with aggregations and groupings

## Architectural Decisions

### Language and Core Technology
- Implementation in C for maximum performance and memory control
- Custom storage engine optimized for our specific use cases
- Columnar storage format for efficient analytical queries
- Row-based indexes for fast point lookups

### Storage Architecture
- Immutable data files with a Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM) approach
- Partition-based storage to facilitate bulk replacements
- Separate storage for metadata, indexes, and data
- Memory-mapped files for fast access where appropriate

### Query Processing
- Simple SQL parser for basic query operations
- Query optimizer focused on our two main query patterns
- Vectorized execution for analytical queries
- Index-based execution for point lookups

### Concurrency Model
- Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) for read operations
- Bulk write operations handled through atomic file operations
- Read-heavy optimization with minimal locking

### Client Interface
- C library with bindings for popular languages (Python, Java, etc.)
- Simple network protocol for client-server communication
- Batch operation API for efficient bulk operations

## Development Phases

2. Implement GROUP BY processing
3. Create columnar scan optimizations
4. Develop query optimizer for analytical patterns
5. Implement filter pushdown and predicate optimization

**Tasks:**
1. Develop network protocol for client-server communication
2. Create C client library
3. Implement language bindings (Python, Java, etc.)
4. Add authentication and authorization
5. Implement logging, monitoring, and diagnostics
6. Create backup and restore functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clients can connect securely to the database
- Multiple programming languages can interact with the database
- Authentication prevents unauthorized access
- Monitoring provides visibility into database performance
- Backup and restore operations work reliably

### Phase 6: Performance Optimization and Scaling (Weeks 31-36)

**Objectives:**
- Optimize performance for production workloads
- Implement distributed capabilities
- Fine-tune memory and disk usage

**Tasks:**
1. Profile and optimize critical code paths
2. Implement memory management improvements
3. Add basic sharding capabilities
4. Develop read replicas for scaling read operations
5. Create performance testing suite with real-world scenarios

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Performance meets or exceeds project goals for both query types
- Memory usage is efficient and configurable
