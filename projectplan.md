# rETL DB Project Plan

## Project Overview

rETL DB is a specialized database designed for Reverse ETL scenarios. It serves as a low-latency data store that receives copies of source-of-truth data from data warehouses to serve online systems efficiently. The database is optimized for:

1. Bulk data operations (full table or partition replacements/additions) rather than row-level mutations
2. Fast row-level lookups (SELECT WHERE id = X)
3. Efficient analytical queries with aggregations and groupings

## Architectural Decisions

### Language and Core Technology
- **Implementation in C for maximum performance and memory control**
  - *What*: Using C as the primary implementation language for the core database engine.
  - *Example*: Like SQLite, PostgreSQL, and other high-performance databases that use C for their core functionality.
  - *Why*: C provides direct memory management, minimal runtime overhead, and predictable performance characteristics. For a database that needs to optimize for both point lookups and analytical queries, the control C offers over memory layout, cache utilization, and system calls is crucial.

- **Custom storage engine optimized for our specific use cases**
  - *What*: Building a purpose-built storage engine rather than adapting an existing one.
  - *Example*: Similar to how RocksDB was built specifically for Facebook's workloads or how ClickHouse created a custom engine for analytical queries.
  - *Why*: Generic storage engines make compromises to support a wide range of workloads. By focusing only on bulk operations, point lookups, and analytical queries, we can make targeted optimizations that wouldn't be possible with a general-purpose engine.

- **Columnar storage format for efficient analytical queries**
  - *What*: Storing data by columns rather than by rows.
  - *Example*: Similar to Apache Parquet or ClickHouse's columnar format.
  - *Why*: Analytical queries typically access a small subset of columns across many rows. Columnar storage allows us to read only the needed columns, dramatically reducing I/O. It also enables better compression since similar data is stored together, and facilitates vectorized processing for aggregations.

- **Row-based indexes for fast point lookups**
  - *What*: Maintaining row-oriented indexes alongside columnar data.
  - *Example*: Similar to how Snowflake combines columnar storage with row-based indexing.
  - *Why*: While columnar storage excels for analytics, point lookups need to quickly locate specific rows. By maintaining specialized indexes that map row identifiers to physical locations, we can achieve sub-millisecond lookups even with columnar underlying storage.

### Storage Architecture
- **Immutable data files with a Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM) approach**
  - *What*: Using immutable files for data storage and organizing them in a tiered structure that periodically merges.
  - *Example*: Similar to how LevelDB, RocksDB, and Cassandra organize their storage.
  - *Why*: Immutable files are perfect for our bulk update model since we don't need to support in-place updates. The LSM approach allows efficient bulk writes (just append new files) while maintaining good read performance through background compaction processes. This approach also provides natural versioning and simplifies concurrency control.

- **Partition-based storage to facilitate bulk replacements**
  - *What*: Dividing tables into logical partitions based on specific criteria (time, category, etc.).
  - *Example*: Similar to how Hive, BigQuery, or Snowflake implement partitioning.
  - *Why*: Partitioning aligns perfectly with reverse ETL workflows where data is often refreshed in logical chunks. By replacing entire partitions atomically, we can efficiently update large portions of data without affecting unrelated partitions. This also improves query performance by enabling partition pruning.

- **Separate storage for metadata, indexes, and data**
  - *What*: Physically separating different types of database information into different files or storage areas.
  - *Example*: Similar to PostgreSQL's approach with separate files for different database objects.
  - *Why*: Different types of information have different access patterns and update frequencies. Metadata is small but frequently accessed, indexes need to optimize for lookup patterns, and data files are large but less frequently read in their entirety. Separation allows optimizing each for its specific use case and simplifies management.

- **Memory-mapped files for fast access where appropriate**
  - *What*: Using the operating system's memory mapping capabilities to access files as if they were in memory.
  - *Example*: Similar to how SQLite or LMDB use memory mapping for performance.
  - *Why*: Memory mapping leverages the OS's virtual memory system to efficiently access data without explicit read/write calls. This is particularly beneficial for indexes and frequently accessed metadata, reducing system call overhead and allowing the OS to optimize caching. For our point lookup use case, this can significantly reduce latency.

### Query Processing
- **Simple SQL parser for basic query operations**
  - *What*: Implementing a focused SQL parser that supports our specific query patterns rather than full SQL compliance.
  - *Example*: Similar to how TimescaleDB or InfluxDB implement SQL-like languages tailored to their use cases.
  - *Why*: Full SQL parsers are complex and resource-intensive. By focusing only on the subset of SQL needed for our use cases (point lookups and analytical queries), we can create a more efficient parser that's easier to optimize and maintain. This also allows us to extend the language with specific features for reverse ETL if needed.

- **Query optimizer focused on our two main query patterns**
  - *What*: Building an optimizer that specifically targets point lookups and analytical aggregation queries.
  - *Example*: Similar to how specialized databases like SingleStore optimize for specific workloads.
  - *Why*: General query optimizers need to handle a wide variety of query patterns, making them complex and sometimes suboptimal for specific cases. By focusing only on our two patterns, we can implement specialized optimization techniques that wouldn't be practical in a general-purpose system, resulting in better performance for our target workloads.

- **Vectorized execution for analytical queries**
  - *What*: Processing data in batches (vectors) rather than row-by-row.
  - *Example*: Similar to how Vectorwise, ClickHouse, or DuckDB implement vectorized execution.
  - *Why*: Vectorized execution dramatically improves CPU efficiency for analytical queries by better utilizing CPU caches, enabling SIMD instructions, and reducing interpretation overhead. This is particularly important for aggregation queries that process large volumes of data and perform mathematical operations.

- **Index-based execution for point lookups**
  - *What*: Using specialized execution paths that leverage indexes for direct data access.
  - *Example*: Similar to how B-tree lookups work in traditional databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
  - *Why*: Point lookups have very different execution characteristics than analytical queries. By creating a separate execution path optimized specifically for index-based access, we can minimize overhead and achieve consistent sub-millisecond performance for these queries, which is critical for online serving use cases.

### Concurrency Model
- **Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) for read operations**
  - *What*: Maintaining multiple versions of data to allow consistent reads without blocking writes.
  - *Example*: Similar to PostgreSQL's or Oracle's MVCC implementation.
  - *Why*: In a reverse ETL scenario, we need to support continuous reads while bulk updates are happening. MVCC allows readers to see a consistent snapshot of data without locking, ensuring that online systems can continuously access data even during large updates. This is particularly important given our focus on bulk operations rather than row-level mutations.

- **Bulk write operations handled through atomic file operations**
  - *What*: Implementing writes by creating new files and atomically switching references.
  - *Example*: Similar to how Parquet files are replaced in data lake systems.
  - *Why*: By leveraging file system atomicity guarantees, we can implement bulk operations that are both efficient and transactionally safe. This approach aligns perfectly with our immutable file design and eliminates the need for complex write-ahead logging or locking protocols typically needed for row-level mutations.

- **Read-heavy optimization with minimal locking**
  - *What*: Designing the system to prioritize read performance with minimal coordination overhead.
  - *Example*: Similar to how Redis or Memcached optimize for read-heavy workloads.
  - *Why*: Reverse ETL databases typically have many more reads than writes, and the writes are batched. By optimizing for this pattern, we can achieve higher throughput and lower latency for the most common operations. Minimal locking reduces contention and improves scalability, particularly important for serving online systems.

### Client Interface
- **C library with bindings for popular languages (Python, Java, etc.)**
  - *What*: Creating a core C library that exposes the database functionality with wrappers for other languages.
  - *Example*: Similar to how SQLite provides a C library with bindings for various languages.
  - *Why*: A C library provides the most direct and efficient access to the database engine. By building language bindings on top of this core library, we can support a wide range of client applications while ensuring consistent behavior and performance across all interfaces.

- **Simple network protocol for client-server communication**
  - *What*: Designing a focused, efficient protocol for communication between clients and the database server.
  - *Example*: Similar to PostgreSQL's wire protocol or Redis's RESP protocol.
  - *Why*: A custom protocol allows us to optimize for our specific query patterns and data types, reducing overhead compared to generic protocols. This is particularly important for low-latency point lookups where protocol efficiency directly impacts response times.

- **Batch operation API for efficient bulk operations**
  - *What*: Providing specialized APIs for performing bulk data operations.
  - *Example*: Similar to ClickHouse's INSERT FROM SELECT or Snowflake's bulk loading capabilities.
  - *Why*: Bulk operations are a core use case for reverse ETL. By providing dedicated APIs optimized for these operations, we can achieve much higher throughput than would be possible with generic single-row operations, making data refreshes faster and more efficient.
